#  Skill 31 Lidar
Author: Ayush Upneja, 2019-11-08

## Summary

In this skill we wired up the Lidar per the specs and programmed the ESP32 I2C to initialize and continuously read from the LIDAR. We displayed the results on the console. We decided that the performance of the sensor was not as consistent and was much more finnicky than the microlidar, so we decided to use two microlidars on the crawler. Below is a video of the lidar in action and the relevant c file is in the code folder.
