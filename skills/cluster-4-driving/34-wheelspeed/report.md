#  Wheel Speed

Author: David Kirk, 2019-11-06

## Summary
This module centers around reading the speed of the crawler from the rotation rate of the wheel. It counts the number of black stripes it sees on one of the wheels, and uses a formula with the wheel's circumference to calculate its speed in m/s. For this skill, the code in this repository does NOT read wheel speed, but instead is just an attempt to use PCNT. For code that does calculate wheel speed, please see this group's Quest 4 ESP-32 code.
